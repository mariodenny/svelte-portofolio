        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Denny Mario. Iâ€™m a passionate and adaptable person with a strong interest in technology,
            education, and everyday life skills. By profession, I teach web development and programming, focusing on
            helping beginners master full-stack development using modern frameworks like Vue.js, Express.js, Svelte, and
            Python. I enjoy breaking down complex topics like OOP, machine learning, IoT, and data security into simple,
            practical lessons.

            Currently, Iâ€™m also working on various side projects, such as building web apps with Laravel, creating game
            prototypes with Python Arcade, and developing smart plant monitoring systems using ESP32 and C++. I like
            experimenting with different tools â€” from Firebase for notifications to PM2 for Node.js deployment â€” and I
            always look for ways to share what I learn.

            Outside of tech, I enjoy physical activities like badminton and fishing, and I find balance by gardening â€”
            growing chilies and flowers at home. I love cooking simple dishes like sambal with fried tempeh and
            anchovies. I believe in living within my means and saving consistently, as I have personal goals like
            upgrading my gear and planning for my future family.

            In the long term, I aim to be a supportive parent who encourages my children to pursue their passions,
            whatever they may be. Iâ€™m always ready to work hard, learn, and adapt â€” whether thatâ€™s teaching, coding, or
            simply enjoying a good game of badminton.</p>
