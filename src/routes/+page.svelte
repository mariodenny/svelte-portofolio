        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Denny Mario, you can call me Denny for short. I am a coding teacher in Medan,
            currently
            working for Kodingnext Indonesia, Medan Branch.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my role, I teach kids from 8â€“16 years old, breaking down complex programming concepts into simple,
            easy-to-digest lessons. Itâ€™s always challenging, but also rewarding to see them grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the side, I love exploring modern tools and frameworks like Laravel, Express, Svelte, Micropython, Flask,
            and React Native. Iâ€™ve worked on various web apps, IoT projects with ESP32, and other personal experiments
            that keep me excited about tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy playing badminton, fishing, and gardening ðŸŒ± â€” they keep me refreshed and
            balanced.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current goal is to inspire more kids and young learners to see coding not just as a skill, but as a
            creative
            tool to bring ideas to life. Iâ€™m also open to collaboration, so feel free to connect with me through
            LinkedIn or GitHub!
        </p>
